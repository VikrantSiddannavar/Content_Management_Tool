# Content_Management_Tool
This repository is to showcase a brief visualisation of Content Management Tool. Which is basically an application that is used to manage content, allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish. Content in a CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates like a website.
